      <h2>Regiments</h2>
      <p>The core combat system relies on 17th-18th-century weapons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jagers</strong> Jagers are one of our two largest infantry divisions. Jagers show accuracy and stealthiness, meant to be able to engage in long ranges when needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Volunteers</strong> Volunteers are one of our two largest infantry divisions. Volunteers show great aggression and speed, meant to be able to engage in melee, close quarters combat and even mid-range when needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Dragoons</strong> The Dragoons are the only cavlary corps in Luxembourg.They show their strategic thinking and fast movement to flank and incircle the enemy.
		They are expected to be ready to engage on the right and the left of the enemy and support infantry as it advances.</li>
		<li><strong>The Royal Guard</strong> The Royal Guards are one of our best and versitile infantry divisions. They are feirce warriors who can manage on their own and are meant to be able to engage when needed. 
		They are considered to have great potential, and with our help and hard training will achieve lot.</li>
		<li><strong>Artillerie Corps</strong> The Artillerie Corps are known for their deadliness on the battlefield. Artillerie Corps were one of the the most blood thirsty regiments/corps in all of lux.

      <h2>Lore/History (Placeholder)</h2>
      <p> We merged into benelux under arch/jimmytheanihilator9 and then it went into the hands of All_Rhino/Peebum. After some time our new leader found it increasingly difficult to manage the new nation and asked the Federation of Mexico
	 to overrule for a bit. Our leader gained skills needed to rule a nation in Mexico and soon made up almost third of their rally many times. Then Luxembourg was born once again and on december 24 we became official in the BV community again.
